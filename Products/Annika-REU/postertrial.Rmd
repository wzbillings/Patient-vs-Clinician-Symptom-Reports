# Introduction

**Motivation: Triage telemedicine could be used as a tool to reduce burden on the healthcare and limit exposure. Triage telemedicine for influenza designates patients into a risk class for having influenza based off of patient reported symptoms data.**

* Currently Clinical Prediction Rules that were designed from clinician reported data are used in telemedicine. 
* Previous research determined that patients and clinicians often disagree on symptoms reporting.
* Patients and Clinicians each filled out a 19 symptom questionnaire during the 2016-2017 influenza season at a University Health Center 

**Question:  Is the disagreement on reported symptoms enough to make clinical prediction rules made from clinician based reports ineffective in telemedicine settings?  If so, can we make an effective CPR that is based off of patient reported symptoms? **

# Clinical Prediction Rules 

We evaluated and compared our model performance to two previous CPRs:

**Ebell Score:** Points are added together based on the combination of symptoms the patient has. 

* 2 points are assigned for fever and cough
* 2 points assigned for myalgias
* 1 point assigned for duration < 48 hours
* 1 point assigned for chills or sweats  

**Afonso Tree:** The Afonso Tree follows a decision tree to determine the risk of the patient.

```{r, out.height='68%', fig.align = "center", fig.cap= "The Alfonso Decision Tree Diagram separates patients into low, moderate, and high risk categories based on symptoms"}

```

# Results

**1. Patients and Clinicians often disagree on the reported symptoms ** 

```{r,out.height='68%', fig.cap="The reporting of symptoms"}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/all_kappa_plot.tiff")
```

**2. Patient reported symptom data can not be substituted in for clinician reported symptom data in a CPR that is clinician based. **

```{r,out.height='68%', fig.cap="The reporting of symptoms"}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/bland-altman-ebell-pcr.png")
```

**3. Using patient reported data instead of clinician reported data will lead to different risk based recommendations. ** 

```{r,out.height='68%', fig.cap="The reporting of symptoms"}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/riskgrouppercent.png")
```

**4. A patient based model with potential to be made into a CPR can be built that improves slightly upon the clinician based CPRs**

# Introduction

**Motivation: During a public health crisis, telemedicine could be used as a tool to triage patients and prevent stress on the health care system. If a patient can get the same diagnosis without an in person visit, burden on the healthcare system could be reduced.**

**Question: Can a patient symptom questionnaire be used to predict influenza diagnosis by a physician?**


* Data collected in previous study at UGA's University Health Center during the 2016-2017 flu season (1).
* A symptom questionnaire containing 19 symptom pairs was given to both patients and clinicians: 
  * Patients filled out symptom questionnaire before the appointment
  * Clinicians filled out symptom questionnaire during the appointment

# Clinical Decision Rules
**We applied 5 clinical decision rules:**
<div style ="float:right;margin-right: 20px;margin-bottom: 5px" markdown="1">
![](Figures/Algorithm flowchart example.png){width=800px}
</div>
* CF (Cough-Fever Rule): Influenza diagnosed if cough and fever are both present
* CFA (Cough-Fever-Acute Onset Rule): Influenza diagnosed if cough and fever are both present for ≤ 2 days
* CFM (Cough-Fever-Myalgia Rule): Influenza diagnosed if cough, fever and muscle pain are all present
* Weighted Flu Score: 2 points given if cough and fever are both present, 2 points given for muscle pain, 1 point for chills/sweats and 1 point if symptoms are present for <= 2 days (3)
* Decision tree: See upper right figure. (2)

# Results
<center>**We found that the clinician's symptom questionnaire outperforms the patient's when predicting influenza diagnosis.**</center>
<div style="padding: 12pt;">

```{r fig4, out.width='100%', fig.cap=""}
CI_table <- readRDS(here::here("8 Auxiliary", "Jackies_REU_poster",
                               "Figures/CI_table.Rda"))
CI_table$score <- c("CF", "CFA", "CFM", "Score", "Tree")
colnames(CI_table) <- c("Decision Rule", "Clinician AUC", "Patient AUC", "Difference", "95% CI")
knitr::kable(CI_table, caption = "The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is an overall measurement of accuracy. We saw a reduction in AUC using the patient questionaire instead of the clinician's.")
```

knitr::include_graphics(
  here::here("8 Auxiliary", "Jackies_REU_poster", "Figures/Diagnosis_ROCS.png"))
```

 
<center>**The clinicians outperformed the patients across multiple performance measures.**</center>
```{r fig5, out.width='95%', fig.align = "center", fig.cap="The closer F1, MCC, sensitivity and specificity are to 1, the better the prediction performance."}
knitr::include_graphics(
  here::here("8 Auxiliary", "Jackies_REU_poster", "Figures/Metrics.png"))
```
<center>**In a sensitivity analysis, we evaluated the clinical decision rules ability to predict PCR confirmed flu status.**</center>
<div style="padding: 12pt;">
```{r fig7, out.width='95%'}
CI_table <- readRDS(here::here("8 Auxiliary", "Jackies_REU_poster",
                               "Figures/PCR_CI_table.Rda"))
CI_table$score <- c("CF", "CFA", "CFM", "Score", "Tree")
colnames(CI_table) <- c("Decision Rule", "Clinician AUC", "Patient AUC", "Difference", "95% CI")
knitr::kable(CI_table, caption = "Comparing AUCs, we found the differences between patients and clinicians are smaller.")
```
</div>

<div style="padding: 12pt;">
<center>**The difference in performance may be explained by the lack of agreement between patients and clinicians.**</center>
```{r fig6, out.width='100%', fig.align = "center", fig.cap="We used Cohen's kappa to quantify agreement between the patient and clinician. "}
knitr::include_graphics(
  here::here("8 Auxiliary", "Jackies_REU_poster", "Figures/KappaPlot_c.png"))
```
</div>


# Conclusion
<!-- * The performance of the clinical decision rules for the patient and clinician rules is statistically significant. -->
* While the loss in accuracy from patient reported symptoms is statistically significant, the clinical significance needs to be evaluated in further studies.
* The weighted flu score performed better than the simple heuristic rules for both patient and clinicians in our population.

  abstract = {Individual signs and symptoms are of limited value for the diagnosis of influenza.To develop a decision tree for the diagnosis of influenza based on a classification and regression tree (CART) analysis.Data from two previous similar cohort studies were assembled into a single dataset. The data were randomly divided into a development set (70\%) and a validation set (30\%). We used CART analysis to develop three models that maximize the number of patients who do not require diagnostic testing prior to treatment decisions. The validation set was used to evaluate overfitting of the model to the training set.Model 1 has seven terminal nodes based on temperature, the onset of symptoms and the presence of chills, cough and myalgia. Model 2 was a simpler tree with only two splits based on temperature and the presence of chills. Model 3 was developed with temperature as a dichotomous variable ({$\geq$}38\textdegree C) and had only two splits based on the presence of fever and myalgia. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCC) for the development and validation sets, respectively, were 0.82 and 0.80 for Model 1, 0.75 and 0.76 for Model 2 and 0.76 and 0.77 for Model 3. Model 2 classified 67\% of patients in the validation group into a high- or low-risk group compared with only 38\% for Model 1 and 54\% for Model 3.A simple decision tree (Model 2) classified two-thirds of patients as low or high risk and had an AUROCC of 0.76. After further validation in an independent population, this CART model could support clinical decision making regarding influenza, with low-risk patients requiring no further evaluation for influenza and high-risk patients being candidates for empiric symptomatic or drug therapy.},

METHODS: The authors used advanced MEDLINE and Google search strategies and conducted a comprehensive review of key pandemic influenza Web sites. Descriptive data extraction and analysis for IT systems were conducted on all of the included pandemic plans. RESULTS: A total of 155 pandemic influenza plans were reviewed: 29 local, 62 state, 63 federal, and 1 global. We found 70 plans that examined IT systems (10 local, 33 state, 26 federal, 1 global), and 85 that did not (19 local, 29 state, 37 federal). Of the 70 plans, 64 described surveillance systems (10 local, 32 state, 21 federal, 1 global), 2 described patient data collection systems (1 state, 1 federal); 4 described other types of IT systems (4 federal), and none were intended for triage. CONCLUSIONS: Although several pandemic plans have been drafted, the majority are high-level general documents that do not describe IT systems. The plans that discuss IT systems focus strongly on surveillance, which fails to recognize the needs of a health care system responding to an influenza pandemic. The best examples of the types of IT systems to guide decision making during a pandemic were found in the Kansas and the Czech Republic pandemic plans, because these systems were designed to collect both patient and surveillance data. Although Ontario has yet to develop such an IT system, several IT systems are in place that could be leveraged to support critical care triage and medical response during an influenza pandemic.},

AIMS: To assess the agreement between self-report and documentation in the medical records of signs/symptoms of respiratory illness (fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat, headache, sinus problems, muscle aches, fatigue, earache, and chills). METHODS: Respondents were 176 research participants in the Hutterite Influenza Prevention Study during the 2008-2009 influenza season with information about the presence or absence of signs/symptoms from both self-report and primary care medical records. RESULTS: Compared with medical records, lower proportions of self-reported fever, sore throat, earache, cough, and sinus problems were found. Total agreements between self-report and medical report of symptoms ranged from 61\% (for sore throat) to 88\% (for muscle aches and earache), with kappa estimates varying from 0.05 (for chills) to 0.41 (for cough) and 0.51 (for earache). Negative agreement was considerably higher (from 68\% for sore throat to 93\% for muscle aches and earache) than positive agreement (from 13\% for chills to 58\% for earache) for each symptom except cough where positive agreement (77\%) was higher than negative agreement (64\%). Agreements varied by age group. We found better agreement for earache (kappa = 0.62) and lower agreements for headache, sinus problems, muscle aches, fatigue, and chills in older children (aged {$>$}5 years) and adults. CONCLUSIONS: Agreements were variable depending on the specific symptom. Contrary to research in other patient populations which suggests that clinicians report fewer symptoms than patients, we found that the medical record captured more symptoms than selfreport. Symptom agreement and disagreement may be affected by the perspectives of the person experiencing them, the observer, the symptoms themselves, measurement error, the setting in which the symptoms were observed and recorded, and the broader community and cultural context of patients.},

RESULTS: When using the ICPC-2 code for fever we could reproduce the seasonal influenza peaks of the winter seasons 07/08, 08/09 and 09/10 as depicted by the Sentinel data. For the pandemic influenza 09/10, we detected a much higher first peak in summer 2009 which correlated with a potential underreporting in the Sentinel system.

In this paper, new indices that provide independent measures of bias and prevalence, as well as of observed agreement, are defined and a simple formula is derived that expresses kappa in terms of these three indices. When comparisons are made between agreement studies it can be misleading to report kappa values alone, and it is recommended that researchers also include quantitative indicators of bias and prevalence.},

  abstract = {Background Home testing for influenza has the potential to aid triage and management decisions for patients with influenza-like illness. As yet, little is known about the effect of the home influenza testing on clinical decision-making via telehealth. The goal of this study was to determine the clinicians' decision thresholds for influenza and whether the availability of a home influenza test affects clinical decisions. Methods We identified primary care physicians at 4 different sites in the US, largely via in-person continuing education meetings. Clinicians were asked for each vignette whether to treat empirically (``rule in''), ask the patient come to the clinic for further evaluation (``test''), or neither test nor treat (``rule out''). They were then given the results of a home influenza test, and were again asked to select from these three options. We measured the agreement of physician estimates of the likelihood of influenza with the probability based on a clinical prediction model. The test and treatment thresholds of influenza were determined based on mixed-effect logistic regressions. Results In total, 202 clinicians made 570 sets of clinical decisions. Agreement between estimated and actual probability of influenza was fair. The test and treatment thresholds were 24\% (95\% CI: 22\% to 25\%) and 63\% (95\% CI: 58\% to 65\%) before revealing the actual likelihood of influenza. After providing the results of a home flu test the thresholds were similar, 26\% (95\% CI: 24\% to 29\%) and 59\% (95\% CI: 56\% to 62\%). However, approximately half of clinicians changed their cliical management decision after being given the home influenza test result, largely by categorizing more patients in the ``rule out'' and ``rule in'' groups, and reducing the need for in-person evaluation from 41\% of patients to only 20\%. Conclusion In the context of a telehealth visit for a patient with influenza-like illness, we identified a test threshold of approximately 25\% and a treatment threshold of approximately 60\%. Adding the home influenza test results reduced uncertainty and significantly decreased the need for in-person visits.

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Influenza vaccination lowers, but does not eliminate, the risk of influenza. Making a reliable, rapid clinical diagnosis is essential to appropriate patient management that may be especially important during shortages of antiviral agents caused by high demand. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the precision and accuracy of symptoms and signs of influenza. A secondary objective was to review the operating characteristics of rapid diagnostic tests for influenza (results available in {$<$}30 min). DATA SOURCES: Structured search strategy using MEDLINE (January 1966-September 2004) and subsequent searches of bibliographies of retrieved articles to identify articles describing primary studies dealing with the diagnosis of influenza based on clinical signs and symptoms. The MEDLINE search used the Medical Subject Headings EXP influenza or EXP influenza A virus or EXP influenza A virus human or EXP influenza B virus and the Medical Subject Headings or terms EXP sensitivity and specificity or EXP medical history taking or EXP physical examination or EXP reproducibility of results or EXP observer variation or symptoms.mp or clinical signs.mp or sensitivity.mp or specificity.mp. STUDY SELECTION: Of 915 identified articles on clinical assessment of influenza-related illness, 17 contained data on the operating characteristics of symptoms and signs using an independent criterion standard. Of these, 11 were eliminated based on 4 inclusion criteria and availability of nonduplicative primary data. DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently reviewed and abstracted data for estimating the likelihood ratios (LRs) of clinical diagnostic findings. Differences were resolved by discussion and consensus. DATA SYNTHESIS: No symptom or sign had a summary LR greater than 2 in studies that enrolled patients without regard to age. For decreasing the likelihood of influenza, the absence of fever (LR, 0.40; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.25-0.66), cough (LR, 0.42; 95\% CI, 0.31-0.57), or nasal congestion (LR, 0.49; 95\% CI, 0.42-0.59) were the only findings that had summary LRs less than 0.5. In studies limited to patients aged 60 years or older, the combination of fever, cough, and acute onset (LR, 5.4; 95\% CI, 3.8-7.7), fever and cough (LR, 5.0; 95\% CI, 3.5-6.9), fever alone (LR, 3.8; 95\% CI, 2.8-5.0), malaise (LR, 2.6; 95\% CI, 2.2-3.1), and chills (LR, 2.6; 95\% CI, 2.0-3.2) increased the likelihood of influenza to the greatest degree. The presence of sneezing among older patients made influenza less likely (LR, 0.47; 95\% CI, 0.24-0.92). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical findings identify patients with influenza-like illness but are not particularly useful for confirming or excluding the diagnosis of influenza. Clinicians should use timely epidemiologic data to ascertain if influenza is circulating in their communities, then either treat patients with influenza-like illness empirically or obtain a rapid influenza test to assist with management decisions.},

LITERATURE SEARCH: An integrative review of the literature was conducted to describe the use of electronic methods for symptom self-report by patients with cancer and to inform best practices. DATA EVALUATION: The final sample for this integrative review consisted of 36 studies (32 quantitative and 4 qualitative). SYNTHESIS: Data analysis was used to summarize the findings of the 36 studies. Patients with cancer found electronic self-report of symptoms to be feasible and the devices usable. Electronic symptom reporting may improve patient-clinician communication, leading to improved physical and psychosocial outcomes. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: In the studies that included an interactive communication component, oncology nurses were central in receiving, reviewing, and reporting changes to the provider. Patients expressed themselves more when consulting with nurses than with physicians.},

Contingency planning should, therefore, be multi-faceted, involving a robust health command structure, the facility to expand critical care provision in terms of space, equipment and staff and cohorting of affected patients in the early stages. It should also be recognised that despite this expansion of critical care, demand will exceed supply and a process for triage needs to be developed that is valid, reproducible, transparent and consistent with distributive justice.

  abstract = {Background To evaluate binary classifications and their confusion matrices, scientific researchers can employ several statistical rates, accordingly to the goal of the experiment they are investigating. Despite being a crucial issue in machine learning, no widespread consensus has been reached on a unified elective chosen measure yet. Accuracy and F1 score computed on confusion matrices have been (and still are) among the most popular adopted metrics in binary classification tasks. However, these statistical measures can dangerously show overoptimistic inflated results, especially on imbalanced datasets. Results The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), instead, is a more reliable statistical rate which produces a high score only if the prediction obtained good results in all of the four confusion matrix categories (true positives, false negatives, true negatives, and false positives), proportionally both to the size of positive elements and the size of negative elements in the dataset. Conclusions In this article, we show how MCC produces a more informative and truthful score in evaluating binary classifications than accuracy and F1 score, by first explaining the mathematical properties, and then the asset of MCC in six synthetic use cases and in a real genomics scenario. We believe that the Matthews correlation coefficient should be preferred to accuracy and F1 score in evaluating binary classification tasks by all scientific communities.},

The scientific community has not agreed on a general-purpose statistical indicator for evaluating two-class confusion matrices (having true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives) yet, even if advantages of the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) over accuracy and F1 score have already been shown.In this manuscript, we reaffirm that MCC is a robust metric that summarizes the classifier performance in a single value, if positive and negative cases are of equal importance. We compare MCC to other metrics which value positive and negative cases equally: balanced accuracy (BA), bookmaker informedness (BM), and markedness (MK). We explain the mathematical relationships between MCC and these indicators, then show some use cases and a bioinformatics scenario where these metrics disagree and where MCC generates a more informative response.Additionally, we describe three exceptions where BM can be more appropriate: analyzing classifications where dataset prevalence is unrepresentative, comparing classifiers on different datasets, and assessing the random guessing level of a classifier. Except in these cases, we believe that MCC is the most informative among the single metrics discussed, and suggest it as standard measure for scientists of all fields. A Matthews correlation coefficient close to +1, in fact, means having high values for all the other confusion matrix metrics. The same cannot be said for balanced accuracy, markedness, bookmaker informedness, accuracy and F1 score.},

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a machine learning-based screening tool using patient-generated health data (PGHD) obtained from a mobile health (mHealth) app. METHODS: We trained a deep learning model based on a gated recurrent unit to screen influenza using PGHD, including each patient's fever pattern and drug administration records. We used meteorological data and app-based surveillance of the weekly number of patients with influenza. We defined a single episode as the set of consecutive days, including the day the user was diagnosed with influenza or another disease. Any record a user entered 24 hours after his or her last record was considered to be the start of a new episode. Each episode contained data on the user's age, gender, weight, and at least one body temperature record. The total number of episodes was 6657. Of these, there were 3326 episodes within which influenza was diagnosed. We divided these episodes into 80\% training sets (2664/3330) and 20\% test sets (666/3330). A 5-fold cross-validation was used on the training set. RESULTS: We achieved reliable performance with an accuracy of 82\%, a sensitivity of 84\%, and a specificity of 80\% in the test set. After the effect of each input variable was evaluated, app-based surveillance was observed to be the most influential variable. The correlation between the duration of input data and performance was not statistically significant (P=.09). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that PGHD from an mHealth app could be a complementary tool for influenza screening. In addition, PGHD, along with traditional clinical data, could be used to improve health conditions.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 continues to have a major impact on healthcare and social systems throughout the world. As the clinical and epidemiological features of COVID-19 have many parallels with influenza, it is important to ensure optimal management of both respiratory diseases as we anticipate their continued co-circulation. In particular, there is a need to ensure that effective surveillance and diagnostic capacities are in place to monitor these and other respiratory viruses, as this will underpin decisions on the appropriate clinical management of the respective diseases. As such, we propose a series of key recommendations for stakeholders, public health authorities, primary care physicians and surveillance bodies that will help mitigate the combined risks of concurrent influenza epidemics and the COVID-19 pandemic. We advocate the judicious use of influenza vaccines and antivirals, particularly among groups at high risk of complications, with healthcare workers also considered a priority for vaccination. It is likely that the increased use of emerging technologies such as telemedicine and contact tracing will permanently change our approach to managing infectious disease. The use of these technologies, alongside existing pharmaceutical strategies, will ensure that we achieve a holistic approach to the global public health measures needed to deal with the combined threat of influenza and COVID-19. Ensuring that this approach is optimal will be key as we move from a reactive pandemic response towards preparing for the long-term management of the remarkable clinical burden associated with these respiratory pathogens.},

Today the expanded capabilities have transformed TH delivery, and from the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, it has remained one of our biggest allies. Telehealth has become a central piece in patient healthcare delivery during COVID-19 pandemic era. Telehealth allows health care services to reach patients in their homes, keeping other patients safe through social distancing and maintaining self-quarantine. Within this administration of health, TH allows health care providers to focus more resources to pandemic usage and at the same time continue caring for the health of non COVID-19 patients. During this time, clinicians are expanding knowledge about TH capabilities, such as application of forward triage as a tool to avoid patient contact in emergency departments. While previously TH was mainly used for primary care needs, specialized and urgent care health is now being utilized more than ever before. These advantages comes with limitations, some of them include a limited physical exam, lack of access to diagnostic testing or imaging, and many other pitfalls and persistent unmet needs.

Although the development and evaluation of a robust, clinically useful CPR is anything but straightforward, adherence to the plethora of methodological standards, recommendations and frameworks at each stage will assist in the development of a rigorous CPR that has the potential to contribute usefully to clinical practice and decision-making and have a positive impact on patient care.},

The first step in this planning process is the development of specific triage requirements during an influenza pandemic. The second step is identification of logistical resources required during such a pandemic, which are then analyzed within the proposed logistics science and art model for planning purposes. Resources highlighted within the model include allocation and use of work force, bed space, intensive care unit assets, ventilators, personal protective equipment, and oxygen. The third step is using the model to discuss in detail possible workarounds, suitable substitutes, and resource allocation. An examination is also made of the ethics surrounding palliative care within the construction of an MCI and the factors that will inevitably determine rationing and prioritizing of these critical assets to palliative care patients.},

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate and compare the knowledge about the clinical features, symptoms and differences between patients with COVID-19, SARS, influenza, and common cold. The research can help ear, nose and throat specialists and other health practitioners manage patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The biomedical databases used in the study included PubMed and MEDLINE. Statistical analysis using the Z-score test assessed which symptoms were more characteristic of COVID-19 than other viral diseases. RESULTS: Among individuals with COVID-19, the most frequently reported symptoms were cough (70\%), fever (45\%), muscular pain (29\%), and headache (21\%), whereas sore throat (12\%), and rhinorrhea (4\%) were observed at lower rates. Fever was identified as most frequent in COVID-19 (74\%), appearing at a higher rate in those cases than in influenza (68\%) or the common cold (40\%) (p {$<$} 0.05). In comparison to other viral diseases, sore throat was rarely reported in COVID-19 and SARS (12\% and 18\%, respectively) (p {$<$} 0.05). In influenza and common cold, a cough was identified in 93\% and 80\% of cases (p {$<$} 0.05). Headache, rhinorrhea, muscular pain, and sore throat were more common in influenza (91\%, 91\%, 94\%, and 84\%, respectively) and common cold (89\%, 81\%, 94\%, and 84\%, respectively) than in COVID-19 (21\%, 4\%, 29\%, and 12\%, respectively) and SARS (45\%, 12\%, 55\%, and 18\%, respectively) (p {$<$} 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of the analysis show that a greater number of general symptoms should lead to a diagnosis of influenza or common cold rather than COVID-19.},

  abstract = {Background: Rapid influenza diagnostic tests that detect the presence of viral antigens are currently used throughout the United States but have poor sensitivity. The objective of this study was to identify if the use of a new highly accurate rapid point of care test would significantly increase the likelihood of guideline consistent care. Methods: We prospectively recruited 300 students at a university health clinic who presented with cough and 1 influenza-like illness symptom between December 2016 and February 2017 to receive care guided by a rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Of the 300 patients receiving the PCR test, 264 had complete medical records and were compared to 771 who received usual care. We used a logistic regression model to identify whether PCR guided care was associated with guideline consistent care, based on the appropriate use of oseltamivir and antibiotics. We also assessed whether PCR guided care decreased the likelihood of return visits within 2 weeks by patients. Results: Logistic regression revealed that the odds of receiving guideline supported care did not significantly increase for patients who received PCR guided care (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.24; 95\% CI, 0.83\textendash 1.88). It significantly decreased the likelihood of an antibiotic prescription (aOR, 0.61; 95\% CI, 0.40\textendash 0.94), increased the likelihood of receiving oseltamivir (aOR, 1.57; 95\% CI, 1.09\textendash 2.28), and decreased the likelihood of return visit within 2 weeks (aOR, 0.19; 95\% CI, 0.04\textendash 0.81). Conclusions: The use of a rapid PCR test did not significantly improve the likelihood of guideline consistent care. However, independent of test outcome, patients who received the test were more likely to receive an antiviral and less likely to receive an antibiotic or have a return visit within 2 weeks.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: 18,500 laboratory-confirmed deaths caused by the 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 were reported worldwide for the period April, 2009, to August, 2010. This number is likely to be only a fraction of the true number of the deaths associated with 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1. We aimed to estimate the global number of deaths during the first 12 months of virus circulation in each country. METHODS: We calculated crude respiratory mortality rates associated with the 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 strain by age (0-17 years, 18-64 years, and {$>$}64 years) using the cumulative (12 months) virus-associated symptomatic attack rates from 12 countries and symptomatic case fatality ratios (sCFR) from five high-income countries. To adjust crude mortality rates for differences between countries in risk of death from influenza, we developed a respiratory mortality multiplier equal to the ratio of the median lower respiratory tract infection mortality rate in each WHO region mortality stratum to the median in countries with very low mortality. We calculated cardiovascular disease mortality rates associated with 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 infection with the ratio of excess deaths from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases during the pandemic in five countries and multiplied these values by the crude respiratory disease mortality rate associated with the virus. Respiratory and cardiovascular mortality rates associated with 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 were multiplied by age to calculate the number of associated deaths. FINDINGS: We estimate that globally there were 201,200 respiratory deaths (range 105,700-395,600) with an additional 83,300 cardiovascular deaths (46,000-179,900) associated with 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1. 80\% of the respiratory and cardiovascular deaths were in people younger than 65 years and 51\% occurred in southeast Asia and Africa. INTERPRETATION: Our estimate of respiratory and cardiovascular mortality associated with the 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 was 15 times higher than reported laboratory-confirmed deaths. Although no estimates of sCFRs were available from Africa and southeast Asia, a disproportionate number of estimated pandemic deaths might have occurred in these regions. Therefore, efforts to prevent influenza need to effectively target these regions in future pandemics. FUNDING: None.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: An accurate diagnosis of influenza is essential for appropriate antiviral treatment, in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. However, no clear guidance exists on which patients should be tested. We sought to develop a clinical decision guideline (CDG) to inform influenza testing decisions for those adult emergency department (ED) patients deemed appropriate for antiviral treatment by CDC guidelines. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed at 4 US EDs. From November 2013 to April 2014, we enrolled adult ED patients with fever or respiratory symptoms who met criteria for antiviral treatment, per 2013 CDC guidelines. All patients were tested for influenza using polymerase chain reaction. Data were randomly split into derivation (80\%) and validation (20\%) data sets. A discrete set of independent variables was selected by logistic regression, using the derivation set to create a scoring system, with a target sensitivity of at least 90\%. The derived CDG was then validated. RESULTS: Of 1941 enrolled participants, 183 (9.4\%) had influenza. The derived CDG included new or increased cough (2 points), headache (1 point), subjective fever (1 point), and triage temperature {$>$}100.4\textdegree C (1 point), with a score of {$\geq$}3 indicating influenza testing was warranted. The CDG had a sensitivity and specificity of 94.1\% and 36.6\%, respectively, in the derivation set and of 91.5\% and 34.6\%, respectively, in the validation set. CONCLUSIONS: A CDG with high sensitivity was derived and validated. Incorporation into practice could standardize testing for high-risk patients in adult EDs during influenza seasons, potentially improving diagnoses and treatment.

  abstract = {PURPOSE In this study, we assessed whether multivariate models and clinical decision rules can be used to reliably diagnose influenza. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of MEDLINE, bibliographies of relevant studies, and previous meta-analyses. We searched the literature (1962-2010) for articles evaluating the accuracy of multivariate models, clinical decision rules, or simple heuristics for the diagnosis of influenza. Each author independently reviewed and abstracted data from each article; discrepancies were resolved by consensus discussion. Where possible, we calculated sensitivity, specificity, predictive value, likelihood ratios, and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS A total of 12 studies met our inclusion criteria. No study prospectively validated a multivariate model or clinical decision rule, and no study performed a split-sample or bootstrap validation of such a model. Simple heuristics such as the so-called fever and cough rule and the fever, cough, and acute onset rule were each evaluated by several studies in populations of adults and children. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were 0.70 and 0.79, respectively. We could not calculate a single summary estimate, however, as the diagnostic threshold varied among studies. CONCLUSIONS The fever and cough, and the fever, cough, and acute onset heuristics have modest accuracy, but summary estimates could not be calculated. Further research is needed to develop and prospectively validate clinical decision rules to identify patients requiring testing, empiric treatment, or neither.},

  abstract = {Methods: We combined data from 2 studies of influenza diagnosis in adult outpatients with suspected influenza: one set in California and one in Switzerland. Patients in both studies underwent a structured history and physical examination and had a reference standard test for influenza (polymerase chain reaction or culture). We randomly divided the dataset into derivation and validation groups and then evaluated simple heuristics and decision rules from previous studies and 3 rules based on our own multivariate analysis. Cutpoints for stratification of risk groups in each model were determined using the derivation group before evaluating them in the validation group. For each decision rule, the positive predictive value and likelihood ratio for influenza in low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups, and the percentage of patients allocated to each risk group, were reported. Results: The simple heuristics (fever and cough; fever, cough, and acute onset) were helpful when positive but not when negative. The most useful and accurate clinical rule assigned 2 points for fever plus cough, 2 points for myalgias, and 1 point each for duration {$<$}48 hours and chills or sweats. The risk of influenza was 8\% for 0 to 2 points, 30\% for 3 points, and 59\% for 4 to 6 points; the rule performed similarly in derivation and validation groups. Approximately two-thirds of patients fell into the low- or high-risk group and would not require further diagnostic testing. Conclusion: A simple, valid clinical rule can be used to guide point-of-care testing and empiric therapy for patients with suspected influenza. (J Am Board Fam Med 2012;25:55\textendash{} 62.)},

  abstract = {Background: Clinical prediction rules (CPRs) can assist clinicians by focusing their clinical evaluation on the most important signs and symptoms, and if used properly can reduce the need for diagnostic testing. This study aims to perform an updated systematic review of clinical prediction rules and classification and regression tree (CART) models for the diagnosis of influenza. Methods: We searched PubMed, CINAHL, and EMBASE databases. We identified prospective studies of patients presenting with suspected influenza or respiratory infection and that reported a CPR in the form of a risk score or CART-based algorithm. Studies had to report at a minimum the percentage of patients in each risk group with influenza. Studies were evaluated for inclusion and data were extracted by reviewers working in parallel. Accuracy was summarized descriptively; where not reported by the authors the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCC), predictive values, and likelihood ratios were calculated. Results: We identified 10 studies that presented 14 CPRs. The most commonly included predictor variables were cough, fever, chills and/or sweats, myalgias, and acute onset, all which can be ascertained by phone or telehealth visit. Most CPRs had an AUROCC between 0.7 and 0.8, indicating good discrimination. However, only 1 rule has undergone prospective external validation, with limited success. Data reporting by the original studies was in some cases inadequate to determine measures of accuracy. Conclusions: Well-designed validation studies, studies of interrater reliability between telehealth an in-person assessment, and studies using novel data mining and artificial intelligence strategies are needed to improve diagnosis of this common and important infection.},

  abstract = {Objective To assess for differences of intended meaning in the description of reflux-related symptoms among otolaryngology patients and clinicians. Study Design Cross-sectional survey-based study. Setting Five tertiary, academic otolaryngology practices. Methods Between June 2020 and July 2022, a questionnaire consisting of 20 common descriptors of reflux-related symptoms within four domains (throat-, chest-, stomach-, and sensory-related symptoms) was completed by patients. Attending otolaryngologists at five academic medical centers then completed the same survey. The primary outcome was to assess differences in patient and clinician perceptions of reflux-related symptoms. Differences based on geographic location was a secondary outcome. Results A total of 324 patients and 27 otolaryngologists participated. Patients selected a median of six terms compared with 10.5 for otolaryngologists (p {$<$} .001). Otolaryngologists were more likely to select sensory symptoms (difference: 35.8\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 19.2\%, 52.4\%), throat-related symptoms (32.4\%; 21.2, 43.6\%), and chest-related symptoms (12.4\%; 8.8, 15.9). Otolaryngologists and patients were equally likely to consider stomach symptoms as related to reflux (4.0\%, -3.7\%, 11.7\%). No significant differences were identified based on geographic location. Conclusion There are differences between otolaryngologists and their patients in the interpretation of the symptoms of reflux. Patients tended to have a narrower interpretation of reflux with symptoms primarily limited to classic stomach-related symptoms, while clinicians tended to have a broader definition of reflux that included extra-esophageal manifestations of disease. This has important counseling implications for the clinician, as patients presenting with reflux symptoms may not comprehend the relationship of those symptoms to reflux disease.},

  abstract = {Influenza is an acute viral respiratory infection that causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Three types of influenza cause disease in humans. Influenza A is the type most responsible for causing pandemics because of its high susceptibility to antigenic variation. Influenza is highly contagious, and the hallmark of infection is abrupt onset of fever, cough, chills or sweats, myalgias, and malaise. For most patients in the outpatient setting, the diagnosis is made clinically, and laboratory confirmation is not necessary. Laboratory testing may be useful in hospitalized patients with suspected influenza and in patients for whom a confirmed diagnosis will change treatment decisions. Rapid molecular assays are the preferred diagnostic tests because they can be done at the point of care, are highly accurate, and have fast results. Treatment with one of four approved anti-influenza drugs may be considered if the patient presents within 48 hours of symptom onset. The benefit of treatment is greatest when antiviral therapy is started within 24 hours of symptom onset. These drugs decrease the duration of illness by about 24 hours in otherwise healthy patients and may decrease the risk of serious complications. No anti-influenza drug has been proven superior. Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all people six months and older who do not have contraindications.},

METHOD: A questionnaire study with questions regarding the symptomatology of influenza among patients aged 60 and older (n = 1838). Thirty-four participating GPs recorded the symptomatology of patients who came to their general practice with influenza-like complaints. The validity of the diagnostic conclusion of the GP, as well as the diagnostic validity of the criteria of the International Classification of Health Problems in Primary Care (ICHPPC-2) and the Sentinel Stations in The Netherlands, was determined with the help of the predictive value and odds ratio, using serologically confirmed influenza as the gold standard. The same method was used to determine which complex of symptoms has the highest predictive value for influenza. The results were verified using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The predictive value of the diagnostics of the GP amounted to 35\%. The predictive values of the diagnostics according to the criteria of the two classification methods were 24\% (Sentinel Stations) and 18\% (ICHPPC-2). Of the individual symptoms, the combination of fever, coughing and acute onset had the highest predictive value (30.3\%) for the diagnosis of influenza. CONCLUSION: It is recommended that the criteria of the Sentinel Stations in The Netherlands and the ICHPPC-2 be adapted in the following way: influenza is likely if, out of the entire complex of symptoms, at least fever, coughing and an acute onset occur.},

Optimizing access to healthcare while minimizing face-to-face patient encounters is critical to limiting exposures, conserving resources, and preserving health. We aimed to evaluate the utility of a COVID-focused telehealth program in avoiding potential in-person visits while maintaining high patient satisfaction. METHODS: All patients with COVID-related virtual visits at our center between March and May 2020 were included. Demographic, satisfaction, and clinical information were gathered using a modified, validated telehealth satisfaction questionnaire disseminated via email or telephone. Data were analyzed using Stata. RESULTS: Of 581 eligible patients, 180 (31\%) responded to the survey. Symptoms (73\%) and possible exposure (22\%) were the main reasons cited for pursuing a virtual visit; cough (44\%) and fever (36\%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Regarding patient satisfaction, most patients rated the experience as "very good" or "excellent", and 94\% of respondents said they would recommend COVID-focused triage through telehealth to others. Over 81\% of patients indicated that, if telehealth was not an option, they would have sought an in-person encounter. Ultimately, only 27\% of patients reported pursuing a face-to-face encounter after participating in the virtual visit. CONCLUSION: Based on patient self-reporting, telemedicine potentially prevented face-to-face COVID-related encounters. Patients expressed satisfaction with the virtual process and were less likely to pursue in-person consultation. Leveraging a telehealth strategy for forward triage has the potential to reduce exposures while conserving healthcare resources.},

Also proposed are new variance estimators for the multiple-rater generalized pi and AC1 statistics, whose validity does not depend upon the hypothesis of independence between raters. This is an improvement over existing alternative variances, which depend on the independence assumption. A Monte-Carlo simulation study demonstrates the validity of these variance estimators for confidence interval construction, and confirms the value of AC1 as an improved alternative to existing inter-rater reliability statistics.},

Online forward triage tools (OFTTs) provide useful information, direct patients and free physician resources.We implemented an OFTT targeted at the current pandemic, adapted the content and goals and assessed its effects. The OFTT was implemented on 2 March 2020 and modified regularly based on the revised testing criteria issued by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health. After testing criteria liberalised, a chatbot tool was set up on 9 April 2020 to assess urgency of testing, referral to available testing sites and need for emergency care.In the first 40 days of the OFTT, there were more than 17\,300 visitors and 69.8\% indicated they would have contacted the healthcare system if the online test had not been available. During the initial week of operation, using the conservative testing strategy, 9.1\% of visitors received recommendations to be tested, which increased to 36.0\% of visitors after a change in testing criteria on 9 March 2020. Overall, since the implementation of the tool, 26.27\% of all users of the site have been directed to obtain testing. The Chatbot tool has had approximately 50 consults/day.Setting up an OFTT should be considered as part of local strategies to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. It may ease the burden on the healthcare system, reassure patients and inform authorities. To account for the dynamic development of the pandemic, frequent adaptation of the tool is of great importance. Further research on clinical outcomes of OFTT is urgently needed.},

  abstract = {Recursive binary partitioning is a popular tool for regression analysis. Two fundamental problems of exhaustive search procedures usually applied to fit such models have been known for a long time: overfitting and a selection bias towards covariates with many possible splits or missing values. While pruning procedures are able to solve the overfitting problem, the variable selection bias still seriously affects the interpretability of tree-structured regression models. For some special cases unbiased procedures have been suggested, however lacking a common theoretical foundation. We propose a unified framework for recursive partitioning which embeds tree-structured regression models into a well defined theory of conditional inference procedures. Stopping criteria based on multiple test procedures are implemented and it is shown that the predictive performance of the resulting trees is as good as the performance of established exhaustive search procedures. It turns out that the partitions and therefore the models induced by both approaches are structurally different, confirming the need for an unbiased variable selection. Moreover, it is shown that the prediction accuracy of trees with early stopping is equivalent to the prediction accuracy of pruned trees with unbiased variable selection. The methodology presented here is applicable to all kinds of regression problems, including nominal, ordinal, numeric, censored as well as multivariate response variables and arbitrary measurement scales of the covariates. Data from studies on glaucoma classification, node positive breast cancer survival and mammography experience are re-analyzed.},

  abstract = {Influenza A/H5N1 infection has become the major emerging infectious disease of global concern again since late 2003. A history of exposure to dead or sick poultry or wild birds occurs in over 60\% of cases of human H5N1 infection. The incubation period of avian-to-human transmission is generally between 2 and 5 days and the median duration of symptoms before hospitalization is about 4.5 days. The clinical spectrum has ranged from asymptomatic infection or mild influenza-like illness to severe pneumonia and multi-organ failure. Fever {$>$} 38 degrees C, cough and dyspnoea are the major symptoms on presentation, whereas gastrointestinal symptoms such as watery diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain are common early in the course of the disease. In contrast, upper respiratory tract symptoms are less prominent in human H5N1 infection when compared to seasonal influenza. Laboratory features of human H5N1 infection include leucopoenia, especially lymphopenia, elevated amino-transaminases, thrombocytopenia, prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time, increased D-Dimer, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine phospho-kinase, and hypoalbuminemia. A low absolute lymphocyte count on admission is associated with more severe disease and death. Radiographic abnormalities include multi-focal airspace consolidation, interstitial infiltrates, patchy or lobar involvement, with rapid progression to bilateral and diffuse ground-glass opacities consistent with ARDS. However, none of the clinical, laboratory and radiographic features are specific to H5N1 infection. A detailed exposure history needs to be elicited, including any close contact with sick or dead poultry, wild birds, other severely ill persons, travel to an area with A/H5N1 activity or work in laboratory handling samples possibly containing A/H5N1 virus.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Estimates of influenza-associated mortality are important for national and international decision making on public health priorities. Previous estimates of 250\hphantom{,}000-500\hphantom{,}000 annual influenza deaths are outdated. We updated the estimated number of global annual influenza-associated respiratory deaths using country-specific influenza-associated excess respiratory mortality estimates from 1999-2015. METHODS: We estimated country-specific influenza-associated respiratory excess mortality rates (EMR) for 33 countries using time series log-linear regression models with vital death records and influenza surveillance data. To extrapolate estimates to countries without data, we divided countries into three analytic divisions for three age groups ({$<$}65 years, 65-74 years, and {$\geq$}75 years) using WHO Global Health Estimate (GHE) respiratory infection mortality rates. We calculated mortality rate ratios (MRR) to account for differences in risk of influenza death across countries by comparing GHE respiratory infection mortality rates from countries without EMR estimates with those with estimates. To calculate death estimates for individual countries within each age-specific analytic division, we multiplied randomly selected mean annual EMRs by the country's MRR and population. Global 95\% credible interval (CrI) estimates were obtained from the posterior distribution of the sum of country-specific estimates to represent the range of possible influenza-associated deaths in a season or year. We calculated influenza-associated deaths for children younger than 5 years for 92 countries with high rates of mortality due to respiratory infection using the same methods. FINDINGS: EMR-contributing countries represented 57\% of the global population. The estimated mean annual influenza-associated respiratory EMR ranged from 0{$\cdot$}1 to 6{$\cdot$}4 per 100\hphantom{,}000 individuals for people younger than 65 years, 2{$\cdot$}9 to 44{$\cdot$}0 per 100\hphantom{,}000 individuals for people aged between 65 and 74 years, and 17{$\cdot$}9 to 223{$\cdot$}5 per 100\hphantom{,}000 for people older than 75 years. We estimated that 291\hphantom{,}243-645\hphantom{,}832 seasonal influenza-associated respiratory deaths (4{$\cdot$}0-8{$\cdot$}8 per 100\hphantom{,}000 individuals) occur annually. The highest mortality rates were estimated in sub-Saharan Africa (2{$\cdot$}8-16{$\cdot$}5 per 100\hphantom{,}000 individuals), southeast Asia (3{$\cdot$}5-9{$\cdot$}2 per 100\hphantom{,}000 individuals), and among people aged 75 years or older (51{$\cdot$}3-99{$\cdot$}4 per 100\hphantom{,}000 individuals). For 92 countries, we estimated that among children younger than 5 years, 9243-105\hphantom{,}690 influenza-associated respiratory deaths occur annually. INTERPRETATION: These global influenza-associated respiratory mortality estimates are higher than previously reported, suggesting that previous estimates might have underestimated disease burden. The contribution of non-respiratory causes of death to global influenza-associated mortality should be investigated. FUNDING: None.},

Whether performing rapid influenza diagnostic tests at triage may shorten emergency department (ED) length of stay (LOS) is remains unclear. We aimed to determine the utility of rapid influenza diagnostic tests at triage in shortening ED length of stay LOS. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients discharged from our ED after receiving results from rapid influenza diagnostic tests during the influenza season from December, 2013 to March, 2019. Eligibility criteria were a walk-in visit, age {$\geq$}15 years, triage performed, rapid influenza diagnostic test administered, and no admission. The triage group received rapid influenza diagnostic tests at triage. The after-examination group received their tests only after examination by a doctor. The primary outcome was ED LOS after propensity score matching to adjust for several covariates. RESULTS: Of 2,768 eligible patients, 2,554 patients were enrolled in the triage group (n = 363) or after examination group (n = 2,191). There were 329 matched pairs after propensity score matching. Median ED LOS was significantly shorter in the triage group than in the after-examination group after propensity score matching (81 min (interquartile range [IQR] 60 to 111) vs 106 min (IQR 80-142); median difference 24 min (95\% confidence interval 17-30)). CONCLUSIONS: Performing rapid influenza diagnostic tests at triage was associated with shorter ED LOS during the influenza season.},

Results Of the 272 patients we studied, 25\% were admitted to an intensive care unit and 7\% died. Forty-five percent of the patients were children under the age of 18 years, and 5\% were 65 years of age or older. Seventy-three percent of the patients had at least one underlying medical condition; these conditions included asthma; diabetes; heart, lung, and neurologic diseases; and pregnancy. Of the 249 patients who underwent chest radiography on admission, 100 (40\%) had findings consistent with pneumonia. Of the 268 patients for whom data were available regarding the use of antiviral drugs, such therapy was initiated in 200 patients (75\%) at a median of 3 days after the onset of illness. Data suggest that the use of antiviral drugs was beneficial in hospitalized patients, especially when such therapy was initiated early.

This pattern of three waves, however, was not universal: in some locations influenza seems to have persisted into or returned in 1920. The recorded statistics of influenza morbidity and mortality are likely to be a significant understatement. Limitations of these data can include nonregistration, missing records, misdiagnosis, and nonmedical certification, and may also vary greatly between locations. Further research has seen the consistent upward revision of the estimated global mortality of the pandemic, which a 1920s calculation put in the vicinity of 21.5 million. A 1991 paper revised the mortality as being in the range 24.7-39.3 million. This paper suggests that it was of the order of 50 million. However, it must be acknowledged that even this vast figure may be substantially lower than the real toll, perhaps as much as 100 percent understated.},

  abstract = {Few viruses have shaped the course of human history more than influenza viruses. A century since the 1918-1919 Spanish influenza pandemic-the largest and deadliest influenza pandemic in recorded history-we have learned much about pandemic influenza and the origins of antigenic drift among influenza A viruses. Despite this knowledge, we remain largely underprepared for when the next major pandemic occurs.While emergency departments are likely to care for the first cases of pandemic influenza, intensive care units (ICUs) will certainly see the sickest and will likely have the most complex issues regarding resource allocation. Intensivists must therefore be prepared for the next pandemic influenza virus. Preparation requires multiple steps, including careful surveillance for new pandemics, a scalable response system to respond to surge capacity, vaccine production mechanisms, coordinated communication strategies, and stream-lined research plans for timely initiation during a pandemic. Conservative models of a large-scale influenza pandemic predict more than 170\% utilization of ICU-level resources. When faced with pandemic influenza, ICUs must have a strategy for resource allocation as strain increases on the system.There are several current threats, including avian influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) viruses. As humans continue to live in closer proximity to each other, travel more extensively, and interact with greater numbers of birds and livestock, the risk of emergence of the next pandemic influenza virus mounts. Now is the time to prepare and coordinate local, national, and global efforts.},

However, it is unclear whether the number of influenza patients is associated with the number of telephone triages in Japan. METHODS: This retrospective, observational study was conducted over the six-year period between January 2012 to December 2017. We used the dataset of a telephone triage service in Osaka, Japan and the data on influenza patients published from the Information Center of Infectious Disease in Osaka prefecture. Using a linear regression model, we calculated Spearman's rank-order coefficient and R2 of the regression model to assess the relationship between the number of telephone triages for fever and the number of influenza patients in Osaka. Furthermore, we calculated Spearman's rank-order coefficient and R2 between the predicted weekly number of influenza patients from the linear regression model and the actual weekly number of influenza patients for influenza outbreak season (December-April). RESULTS: There were 465,971 patients with influenza, and the number of telephone triages for fever was 420,928 among 1,065,628 total telephone triages during the study period. Our analysis showed that the Spearman rank-order coefficient was 0.932, and R2 and adjusted R2 were 0.869 and 0.842, respectively. The Spearman rank-order coefficient was 0.923 (P{$<$}0.001) and R2 was 0.832 in December-April (P{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSION: We revealed a positive relationship in this population between the number of influenza patients and the number of telephone triages for fever.},

  abstract = {Objectives Accurate and reliable criteria to rapidly estimate the probability of infection with the novel coronavirus-2 that causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and associated disease (COVID-19) remain an urgent unmet need, especially in emergency care. The objective was to derive and validate a clinical prediction score for SARS-CoV-2 infection that uses simple criteria widely available at the point of care. Methods Data came from the registry data from the national REgistry of suspected COVID-19 in EmeRgency care (RECOVER network) comprising 116 hospitals from 25 states in the US. Clinical variables and 30-day outcomes were abstracted from medical records of 19,850 emergency department (ED) patients tested for SARS-CoV-2. The criterion standard for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 required a positive molecular test from a swabbed sample or positive antibody testing within 30 days. The prediction score was derived from a 50\% random sample (n = 9,925) using unadjusted analysis of 107 candidate variables as a screening step, followed by stepwise forward logistic regression on 72 variables. Results Multivariable regression yielded a 13-variable score, which was simplified to a 13-point score: +1 point each for age{$>$}50 years, measured temperature{$>$}37.5\r{}C, oxygen saturation{$<$}95\%, Black race, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, household contact with known or suspected COVID-19, patient reported history of dry cough, anosmia/dysgeusia, myalgias or fever; and -1 point each for White race, no direct contact with infected person, or smoking. In the validation sample (n = 9,975), the probability from logistic regression score produced an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 (95\% CI: 0.79\textendash 0.81), and this level of accuracy was retained across patients enrolled from the early spring to summer of 2020. In the simplified score, a score of zero produced a sensitivity of 95.6\% (94.8\textendash 96.3\%), specificity of 20.0\% (19.0\textendash 21.0\%), negative likelihood ratio of 0.22 (0.19\textendash 0.26). Increasing points on the simplified score predicted higher probability of infection (e.g., {$>$}75\% probability with +5 or more points). Conclusion Criteria that are available at the point of care can accurately predict the probability of SARSCoV-2 infection. These criteria could assist with decisions about isolation and testing at high throughput checkpoints.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is a widely used reliability index in test-retest, intrarater, and interrater reliability analyses. This article introduces the basic concept of ICC in the content of reliability analysis. DISCUSSION FOR RESEARCHERS: There are 10 forms of ICCs. Because each form involves distinct assumptions in their calculation and will lead to different interpretations, researchers should explicitly specify the ICC form they used in their calculation. A thorough review of the research design is needed in selecting the appropriate form of ICC to evaluate reliability. The best practice of reporting ICC should include software information, "model," "type," and "definition" selections. DISCUSSION FOR READERS: When coming across an article that includes ICC, readers should first check whether information about the ICC form has been reported and if an appropriate ICC form was used. Based on the 95\% confident interval of the ICC estimate, values less than 0.5, between 0.5 and 0.75, between 0.75 and 0.9, and greater than 0.90 are indicative of poor, moderate, good, and excellent reliability, respectively. CONCLUSION: This article provides a practical guideline for clinical researchers to choose the correct form of ICC and suggests the best practice of reporting ICC parameters in scientific publications. This article also gives readers an appreciation for what to look for when coming across ICC while reading an article.},

These services are often administered through an electronic TT system, which guides TT professionals during the encounter through the use of structured protocols and algorithms to help determine the severity of the patients' health issue and refer them to appropriate care.

Influenza-coded calls were strongly correlated with weekly VA influenza-coded hospitalizations (0.85), emergency department visits (0.90), influenza-like illness outpatient visits (0.92), influenza tests performed (0.86), positive influenza tests (0.82), and influenza antiviral prescriptions (0.89). The correlation between VA-TT and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) national data for weekly influenza hospitalizations, influenza tests performed, and positive influenza tests was also strong. TT correlates well with VA health care use and CDC data and is a timely data source for monitoring influenza activity.},

  abstract = {Introduction\hspace{0.6em} Diagnostic tests for influenza in Australia are currently only authorised for use in clinical settings. At-\-home diagnostic testing for influenza could reduce the need for patient contact with healthcare services, which potentially could contribute to symptomatic improvement and reduced spread of influenza. We aim to determine the accuracy of an app-\-guided nasal self-\-swab combined with a lateral flow immunoassay for influenza conducted by individuals with influenza-\-like illness (ILI). Methods and analysis\hspace{0.6em} Adults ({$\geq$}18\,years) presenting with ILI will be recruited by general practitioners (GP) participating in Australian Sentinel Practices Research Network. Eligible participants will have a nasal swab obtained by their GP for verification of influenza A/B status using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-\-PCR) test at an accredited laboratory. Participants will receive an influenza test kit and will download an app that collects self-\-reported symptoms and influenza risk factors, then instructs them in obtaining a low-\-nasal self-\-swab, running a QuickVue influenza A+B lateral flow immunoassay (Quidel Corporation) and interpreting the results. Participants will also interpret an enhanced image of the test strip in the app. The primary outcome will be the accuracy of participants' test interpretation compared with the laboratory RT-\-PCR reference standard. Secondary analyses will include accuracy of the enhanced test strip image, accuracy of an automatic test strip reader algorithm and validation of prediction rules for influenza based on self-\-reported symptoms. A post-\-test survey will be used to obtain participant feedback on self-\-test procedures. Ethics and dissemination\hspace{0.6em} The study was approved by the Human Research and Ethic Committee (HREC) at the University of Adelaide (H-2019-116). Protocol details and any amendments will be reported to https://www.tga. gov.au/. Results will be published in the peer-\-reviewed literature, and shared with stakeholders in the primary care and diagnostics communities.},

Respondent definitions for congestion were selected from a list of 16 proposed terms covering 4 general categories.Symptom categories for term used to describe congestion by patients and clinicians.Among 226 patient respondents (133 female [58.8\%]; mean [SD] age, 54 [15.6] years), the most commonly selected definitions for congestion were from the obstructive (199; 88.1\%) and mucus-related (196; 86.7\%) symptom categories. More than 1 general category was selected by 208 patients (92.0\%), whereas 11 patients (4.9\%) described congestion only in terms of mucus-related symptoms. Definitions were limited to upper respiratory tract symptoms by 83 (36.7\%) patients and lower respiratory tract symptoms by 2 (0.9\%) patients. Among 31 otolaryngologists, congestion was most frequently defined in terms of obstructive symptoms (difference, 11.9\%; 95\% CI, 7.4\%-16.5\%). In contrast, patients more often described congestion in terms of pressure-related (difference, 38.8\%; 95\% CI, 7.5\%-70.1\%) or mucus-related (difference, 51.2\%; 95\% CI, 22.6\%-79.9\%) symptoms. A total of 22 otolaryngologists (71.0\%) defined congestion using 1 to 4 symptoms, compared with only 69 patients (30.5\%).The definition of congestion appears to be highly variable and ambiguous for many patients. Moreover, the findings suggest that patients and otolaryngologists generally do not describe congestion using the same terms.},

The importance of rater reliability lies in the fact that it represents the extent to which the data collected in the study are correct representations of the variables measured. Measurement of the extent to which data collectors (raters) assign the same score to the same variable is called interrater reliability. While there have been a variety of methods to measure interrater reliability, traditionally it was measured as percent agreement, calculated as the number of agreement scores divided by the total number of scores. In 1960, Jacob Cohen critiqued use of percent agreement due to its inability to account for chance agreement. He introduced the Cohen's kappa, developed to account for the possibility that raters actually guess on at least some variables due to uncertainty. Like most correlation statistics, the kappa can range from -1 to +1. While the kappa is one of the most commonly used statistics to test interrater reliability, it has limitations. Judgments about what level of kappa should be acceptable for health research are questioned. Cohen's suggested interpretation may be too lenient for health related studies because it implies that a score as low as 0.41 might be acceptable. Kappa and percent agreement are compared, and levels for both kappa and percent agreement that should be demanded in healthcare studies are suggested.},

  abstract = {Background: Reducing the number of antibiotic prescriptions given for common respiratory infections has been recommended as a way to limit bacterial resistance. This study assessed the validity of a previously published clinical score for the management of infections of the upper respiratory tract accompanied by sore throat. The study also examined the potential impact of this clinical score on the prescribing of antibiotics in community-based family practice. Methods: A total of 97 family physicians in 49 Ontario communities assessed 621 children and adults with a new infection of the upper respiratory tract accompanied by sore throat and recorded their prescribing decisions. A throat swab was obtained for culture. The sensitivity and specificity of the score approach in this population were compared with previously published results for patients seen at an academic family medicine centre. In addition, physicians' prescribing practices and their recommendations for obtaining throat swabs were compared with score-based recommendations. Results: Of the 621 cases of new upper respiratory tract infection and sore throat, information about prescriptions given was available for only 619; physicians prescribed antibiotics in 173 (27.9\%) of these cases. Of the 173 prescriptions, 109 (63.0\%) were given to patients with culture-negative results for group A Streptococcus. Using the score to determine management would have reduced prescriptions to culture-negative patients by 63.7\% and overall antibiotic prescriptions by 52.3\% (both p {$<$} 0.01). Culturing of throat samples would have been reduced by 35.8\% (p {$<$} 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference in the sensitivity or specificity of the score approach between this community-based population (sensitivity 85.0\%, specificity 92.1\%) and an academic family medicine centre (sensitivity 83.1\%, specificity 94.3\%). Interpretation: An explicit clinical score approach to the management of patients presenting with an upper respiratory tract infection and sore throat is valid in community-based family practice and could substantially reduce the unnecessary prescribing of antibiotics for these condition},

While some symptoms may be transmission-enhancing, other symptoms are likely to reduce transmission potential. For human diseases, the reduction in transmission opportunities is commonly caused by reduced activity. There is limited data regarding the potential impact of virulence on transmission potential. We performed an exploratory data analysis of 324 influenza patients at a university health centre during the 2016/2017 influenza season. We classified symptoms as infectiousness-related or morbidity-related and calculated two scores. The scores were used to explore the relationship between infectiousness, morbidity (virulence), and activity level. We found a decrease in the activity level with increasing morbidity scores. There was no consistent pattern between an activity level and an infectiousness score. We also found a positive correlation between morbidity and infectiousness scores. Overall, we find that increasing virulence leads to increased infectiousness and reduced activity, suggesting a trade-off that can impact overall transmission potential. Our findings indicate that a reduction of systemic symptoms may increase host activity without reducing infectiousness. Therefore, interventions should target both systemic- and infectiousness-related symptoms to reduce overall transmission potential. Our findings can also inform simulation models that investigate the impact of different interventions on transmission.},

PURPOSE: To summarize and compare accuracy of traditional rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs), digital immunoassays (DIAs), and rapid nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) in children and adults with suspected influenza. DATA SOURCES: 6 databases from their inception through May 2017. STUDY SELECTION: Studies in English, French, or Spanish comparing commercialized rapid tests (that is, providing results in {$<$}30 minutes) with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction reference standard for influenza diagnosis. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted using a standardized form; quality was assessed using QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2) criteria. DATA SYNTHESIS: 162 studies were included (130 of RIDTs, 19 of DIAs, and 13 of NAATs). Pooled sensitivities for detecting influenza A from Bayesian bivariate random-effects models were 54.4\% (95\% credible interval [CrI], 48.9\% to 59.8\%) for RIDTs, 80.0\% (CrI, 73.4\% to 85.6\%) for DIAs, and 91.6\% (CrI, 84.9\% to 95.9\%) for NAATs. Those for detecting influenza B were 53.2\% (CrI, 41.7\% to 64.4\%) for RIDTs, 76.8\% (CrI, 65.4\% to 85.4\%) for DIAs, and 95.4\% (CrI, 87.3\% to 98.7\%) for NAATs. Pooled specificities were uniformly high ({$>$}98\%). Forty-six influenza A and 24 influenza B studies presented pediatric-specific data; 35 influenza A and 16 influenza B studies presented adult-specific data. Pooled sensitivities were higher in children by 12.1 to 31.8 percentage points, except for influenza A by rapid NAATs (2.7 percentage points). Pooled sensitivities favored industry-sponsored studies by 6.2 to 34.0 percentage points. Incomplete reporting frequently led to unclear risk of bias. LIMITATIONS: Underreporting of clinical variables limited exploration of heterogeneity. Few NAAT studies reported adult-specific data, and none evaluated point-of-care testing. Many studies had unclear risk of bias. CONCLUSION: Novel DIAs and rapid NAATs had markedly higher sensitivities for influenza A and B in both children and adults than did traditional RIDTs, with equally high specificities.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: During an influenza epidemic prompt diagnosis of influenza is important. This diagnosis however is still essentially based on the interpretation of symptoms and signs by general practitioners. No single symptom is specific enough to be useful in differentiating influenza from other respiratory infections. Our objective is to formulate prediction rules for the diagnosis of influenza with the best diagnostic performance, combining symptoms, signs and context among patients with influenza-like illness. METHODS: During five consecutive winter periods (2002-2007) 138 sentinel general practitioners sampled (naso- and oropharyngeal swabs) 4597 patients with an influenza-like illness (ILI) and registered their symptoms and signs, general characteristics and contextual information. The samples were analysed by a DirectigenFlu-A\&B and RT-PCR tests. 4584 records were useful for further analysis.Starting from the most relevant variables in a Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) model, we calculated the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC AUC), sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios for positive (LR+) and negative test results (LR-) of single and combined signs, symptoms and context taking into account pre-test and post-test odds. RESULTS: In total 52.6\% (2409/4584) of the samples were positive for influenza virus: 64\% (2066/3212) during and 25\% (343/1372) pre/post an influenza epidemic. During and pre/post an influenza epidemic the LR+ of 'previous flu-like contacts', 'coughing', 'expectoration on the first day of illness' and 'body temperature above 37.8\textdegree C' is 3.35 (95\%CI 2.67-4.03) and 1.34 (95\%CI 0.97-1.72), respectively. During and pre/post an influenza epidemic the LR- of 'coughing' and 'a body temperature above 37.8\textdegree C' is 0.34 (95\%CI 0.27-0.41) and 0.07 (95\%CI 0.05-0.08), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Ruling out influenza using clinical and contextual information is easier than ruling it in. Outside an influenza epidemic the absence of cough and fever ({$>$} 37,8\textdegree C) makes influenza 14 times less likely in ILI patients. During an epidemic the presence of 'previous flu-like contacts', cough, 'expectoration on the first day of illness' and fever ({$>$}37,8\textdegree C) increases the likelihood for influenza threefold. The additional diagnostic value of rapid point of care tests especially for confirming influenza still has to be established.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: New antiviral drugs are available for the treatment of influenza type A and type B infections. In clinical practice, antiviral use has rarely been guided by antecedent laboratory diagnosis. Defined clinical predictors of an influenza infection can help guide timely therapy and avoid unnecessary antibiotic use. OBJECTIVE: To examine which clinical signs and symptoms are most predictive of influenza infection in patients with influenza-like illness using a large data set derived from clinical trials of zanamivir. METHODS: This analysis is a retrospective, pooled analysis of baseline signs and symptoms from phase 2 and 3 clinical trial participants. It was conducted in mainly unvaccinated (mean age, 35 years) adults and adolescents who had influenza-like illness, defined as having fever or feverishness plus at least 2 of the following influenza-like symptoms: headache, myalgia, cough, or sore throat who underwent laboratory testing for influenza. Clinical signs and symptoms were evaluated in statistical models to identify those best predicting laboratory confirmation of influenza. RESULTS: Of 3744 subjects enrolled with baseline influenza-like symptoms, and included in this analysis, 2470 (66\%) were confirmed to have influenza. Individuals with influenza were more likely to have cough (93\% vs 80\%), fever (68\% vs 40\%), cough and fever together (64\% vs 33\%), and/or nasal congestion (91\% vs 81\%) than those without influenza. The best multivariate predictors of influenza infections were cough and fever with a positive predictive value of 79\% (P{$<$}. 001). The positive predictive value rose with the increase in the temperature at the time of recruitment. CONCLUSION: When influenza is circulating within the community, patients with an influenza-like illness who have both cough and fever within 48 hours of symptom onset are likely to have influenza and the administration of influenza antiviral therapy may be appropriate to consider.

  abstract = {Objectives: Accurate estimation of the risk of SARS-\-CoV-\-2 infection based on bedside data alone has importance to emergency department (ED) operations and throughput. The 13-\-item CORC (COVID [or coronavirus] Rule-\-out Criteria) rule had good overall diagnostic accuracy in retrospective derivation and validation. The objective of this study was to prospectively test the inter-\-rater reliability and diagnostic accuracy of the CORC score and rule (score {$\leq$} 0 negative, {$>$} 0 positive) and compare the CORC rule performance with physician gestalt. Methods: This noninterventional study was conducted at an urban academic ED from February 2021 to March 2021. Two practitioners were approached by research coordinators and asked to independently complete a form capturing the CORC criteria for their shared patient and their gestalt binary prediction of the SARS-\-CoV-\-2 test result and confidence (0\%\textendash\-100\%). The criterion standard for SARS-\-CoV-\-2 was from reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction performed on a nasopharyngeal swab. The primary analysis was from weighted Cohen's kappa and likelihood ratios (LRs). Results: For 928 patients, agreement between observers was good for the total CORC score, {$\kappa$} = 0.613 (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.579\textendash\-0.646), and for the CORC rule, {$\kappa$} = 0.644 (95\% CI = 0.591\textendash\-0.697). The agreement for clinician gestalt binary determination of SARs-\-CoV-\-2 status was {$\kappa$} = 0.534 (95\% CI = 0.437\textendash\-0.632) with median confidence of 76\% (first\textendash\-third quartile = 66\textendash\-88.5). For 425 patients who had the criterion standard, a negative CORC rule (both observers scored CORC {$<$} 0), the sensitivity was 88\%, and specificity was 51\%, with a negative LR (LR-) of 0.24 (95\% CI = 0.10\textendash\-0.50). Among patients with a mean CORC score of {$>$}4, the prevalence of a positive SARS-\- CoV-\-2 test was 58\% (95\% CI = 28\%\textendash\-85\%) and positive LR was 13.1 (95\% CI = 4.5\textendash\- 37.2). Clinician gestalt demonstrated a sensitivity of 51\% and specificity of 86\% with a LR- of 0.57 (95\% CI = 0.39\textendash\-0.74). Conclusion: In this prospective study, the CORC score and rule demonstrated good inter-\-rater reliability and reproducible diagnostic accuracy for estimating the pretest probability of SARs-\-CoV-\-2 infection.},

  abstract = {In the event of a novel influenza strain that is markedly different to the current strains circulating in humans, the population have little/no immunity and infection spreads quickly causing a global pandemic. Over the past century, there have been four major influenza pandemics: the 1918 pandemic (``Spanish Flu''), the 1957\textendash 58 pandemic (the ``Asian Flu''), the 1967\textendash 68 pandemic (the ``Hong Kong Flu'') and the 2009 pandemic (the ``Swine flu''). To inform planning against future pandemics, this paper investigates how different is the net-present value of employing pre-purchase and responsive- purchased vaccine programmes in presence and absence of anti-viral drugs to scenarios that resemble these historic influenza pandemics. Using the existing literature and in discussions with policy decision makers in the UK, we first characterised the four past influenza pandemics by their transmissibility and infection-severity. For these combinations of parameters, we then projected the net-present value of employing pre-purchase vaccine (PPV) and responsive-purchase vaccine (RPV) programmes in presence and absence of anti-viral drugs. To differentiate between PPV and RPV policies, we changed the vaccine effectiveness value and the time to when the vaccine is first available. Our results are ``heat-map'' graphs displaying the benefits of different strategies in pandemic scenarios that resemble historic influenza pandemics. Our results suggest that immunisation with either PPV or RPV in presence of a stockpile of effective antiviral drugs, does not have positive net-present value for all of the pandemic scenarios considered. In contrast, in the absence of effective antivirals, both PPV and RPV policies have positive net-present value across all the pandemic scenarios. Moreover, in all considered circumstances, vaccination was most beneficial if started sufficiently early and covered sufficiently large number of people. When comparing the two vaccine programmes, the RPV policy allowed a longer timeframe and lower coverage to attain the same benefit as the PPV policy. Our findings suggest that responsive-purchase vaccination policy has a bigger window of positive net-present value when employed against each of the historic influenza pandemic strains but needs to be rapidly available to maximise benefit. This is important for future planning as it suggests that future preparedness policies may wish to consider utilising timely (i.e. responsive-purchased) vaccines against emerging influenza pandemics.},

But despite their successful use in many applied domains, there is no widely available toolbox that allows anyone to easily create, visualize, and evaluate FFTs. We fill this gap by introducing the R package FFTrees. In this paper, we explain how FFTs work, introduce a new class of algorithms called fan for constructing FFTs, and provide a tutorial for using the FFTrees package. We then conduct a simulation across ten real-world datasets to test how well FFTs created by FFTrees can predict data. Simulation results show that FFTs created by FFTrees can predict data as well as popular classification algorithms such as regression and random forests, while remaining simple enough for anyone to understand and use.

The study population of 3306 patients included 82\% outpatients and 57\% women.InterventionsPatients were categorized as ``pulmonary embolism unlikely'' or ``pulmonary embolism likely'' using a dichotomized version of the Wells clinical decision rule. Patients classified as unlikely had D-dimer testing, and pulmonary embolism was considered excluded if the D-dimer test result was normal. All other patients underwent CT, and pulmonary embolism was considered present or excluded based on the results. Anticoagulants were withheld from patients classified as excluded, and all patients were followed up for 3 months.Main Outcome MeasureSymptomatic or fatal venous thromboembolism (VTE) during 3-month follow-up.ResultsPulmonary embolism was classified as unlikely in 2206 patients (66.7\%). The combination of pulmonary embolism unlikely and a normal D-dimer test result occurred in 1057 patients (32.0\%), of whom 1028 were not treated with anticoagulants; subsequent nonfatal VTE occurred in 5 patients (0.5\% [95\% confidence interval \{CI\}, 0.2\%-1.1\%]). Computed tomography showed pulmonary embolism in 674 patients (20.4\%). Computed tomography excluded pulmonary embolism in 1505 patients, of whom 1436 patients were not treated with anticoagulants; in these patients the 3-month incidence of VTE was 1.3\% (95\% CI, 0.7\%-2.0\%). Pulmonary embolism was considered a possible cause of death in 7 patients after a negative CT scan (0.5\% [95\% CI, 0.2\%-1.0\%]). The algorithm was completed and allowed a management decision in 97.9\% of patients.ConclusionsA diagnostic management strategy using a simple clinical decision rule, D-dimer testing, and CT is effective in the evaluation and management of patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism. Its use is associated with low risk for subsequent fatal and nonfatal VTE.},

This book is a complete guide to the C4.5 system as implemented in C for the UNIX environment. It contains a comprehensive guide to the system's use , the source code (about 8,800 lines), and implementation notes. C4.5 starts with large sets of cases belonging to known classes. The cases, described by any mixture of nominal and numeric properties, are scrutinized for patterns that allow the classes to be reliably discriminated. These patterns are then expressed as models, in the form of decision trees or sets of if-then rules, that can be used to classify new cases, with emphasis on making the models understandable as well as accurate. The system has been applied successfully to tasks involving tens of thousands of cases described by hundreds of properties. The book starts from simple core learning methods and shows how they can be elaborated and extended to deal with typical problems such as missing data and over hitting. Advantages and disadvantages of the C4.5 approach are discussed and illustrated with several case studies. This book should be of interest to developers of classification-based intelligent systems and to students in machine learning and expert systems courses.},

Setting Six academic outpatient otolaryngology practices. Methods We performed a multi-institutional, cross-sectional study using a semantics-based questionnaire. Consecutive patients were enrolled at 6 academic otolaryngology centers from June 2020 to May 2021. The primary outcome examined patient and provider definitions for the symptoms caused by the sinuses from a list of 28 proposed terms covering 6 general categories. These data were also collected from otolaryngology faculty at the same institutions. Results Responses were obtained from 451 patients (54\% female, mean age 48.3 years) and 29 otolaryngologists (38\% female, mean age 37.4 years). Patients selected a median of 12 terms, compared to 8.5 for otolaryngologists. Among patients, the most frequently selected symptom domains were mucus (419, 92.9\%), airflow (412, 91.4\%), and pain (389, 86.3\%). Compared to clinicians, patients more frequently selected symptoms related to the ear (difference, 48.3\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 34.8\%-59.3\%), throat (difference, 35.7\%, 95\% CI, 22.0\%-47.5\%), systemic (difference, 34.4\%, 95\% CI, 21.2\%-46.0\%), mucus (difference, 20.5\%, 95\% CI, 10.2\%-30.6\%), and airflow domains (difference, 19.0\%, 95\% CI, 8.4\%-29.3\%). Multiple domains were selected by 98\% of patients and 79\% of providers. Conclusion Semantic differences exist between patients and clinicians regarding the symptoms caused by the sinus with patients having a broader range of perceived symptoms. These differences may provide clues to improve communication between otolaryngologists and their patients.},

  abstract = {Introduction Sinus infections are a common reason patients seek medical care. However, the intended meaning of the term sinus infection among patients and otolaryngologists is incompletely understood. Methods In this multi-institutional cross-sectional study, a semantics-based questionnaire was provided to consecutive patients presenting to otolaryngology clinics at six academic centers from June 2020 until May 2021. The primary outcome was respondent definitions for sinus infection from a list of 28 proposed terms covering six general categories. Secondary outcome measures included differences between geographic regions. Results Responses were obtained from 560 patients (54\% female, mean age 48.9 years) and 29 otolaryngologists (42\% female, mean age 37.4 years). Patients and otolaryngologists selected a median of 10 and 11 terms, respectively, to define a sinus infection. Among patients the most frequently selected symptom categories were mucus (500, 89.3\%), pressure/pain (480, 85.7\%), and airflow (468, 83.6\%). Compared to patients, clinicians selected with greater frequency the symptom categories of pressure/pain (14.3\% difference; 95\% CI, 7.6\% to 22.5\%), mucus (10.7\% difference; 95\% CI, 4.7\% to 18.3\%) and airflow (13.0\% difference; 95\% CI, 4.8\% to 21.7\%). Multiple categories were selected by 96\% of patients and 100\% of providers. Conclusion The definition of sinus infection appears variable for both patients and otolaryngologists, though patients appear to apply a broader range of symptoms to the term sinus infection. There were no pronounced geographic differences in the description of a sinus infection in this US sample population. Patients commonly described sinus infection in the context of pain-related symptoms. Appreciation of these semantic differences may enable more effective patient-clinician communication.},

Historically, estimates of the burden of seasonal influenza in the United States, focused mainly on influenza-related mortality and hospitalization, were generated every few years. Since the 2010-2011 influenza season, annual US influenza burden estimates have been generated and expanded to include estimates of influenza-related outpatient medical visits and symptomatic illness in the community. Methods We used routinely collected surveillance data, outbreak field investigations, and proportions of people seeking health care from survey results to estimate the number of illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths due to influenza during six influenza seasons (2010-2011 through 2015-2016). Results We estimate that the number of influenza-related illnesses that have occurred during influenza season has ranged from 9.2~million to 35.6~million, including 140~000 to 710~000 influenza-related hospitalizations. Discussion These annual efforts have strengthened public health communications products and supported timely assessment of the impact of vaccination through estimates of illness and hospitalizations averted. Additionally, annual estimates of influenza burden have highlighted areas where disease surveillance needs improvement to better support public health decision making for seasonal influenza epidemics as well as future pandemics.},

We designed the Patient Centered Assessment of Symptoms (PCAS) registry to measure discrepancies between patient-reported and clinician-documented symptoms. OBJECTIVE: Use patient-derived symptoms data to measure discrepancies with clinical documentation. METHODS: The PCAS registry captured data from a prospective cohort of patients undergoing myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) and includes free response and structured questions to gauge symptoms. Clinician-documented symptoms were extracted from the patients' medical records. The appropriateness of testing was determined twice: once using the patient-reported symptoms and once using the clinician-documented symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 90 subjects were enrolled, among whom diabetes (36.7\%), prior coronary disease (28.9\%), hypertension (80.0\%) and hyperlipidemia (85.6\%) were common. Percentage of patient-reported symptoms compared to clinician-documented symptoms and agreement were as follows: chest pain (patient 29.0\%, clinician 36.6\%, moderate [kappa = 0.54]), chest pressure (patient 18.3\%, clinician 10.8\%, fair [kappa = 0.27]), dyspnea (patient 41.0\%, clinician 36.6\%, fair [kappa = 0.28]), onset with exertion (patient 61.7\%, clinician 59.6\%, slight [kappa = 0.17]), symptoms same as prior coronary artery disease (patient 46.2\%, clinician 15.3\%, slight [kappa = 0.01]). As a result of these inconsistencies, appropriateness ratings were different for 13.3\% (n\,=\,12) subjects. CONCLUSION: In this prospective registry of patients undergoing MPI, we observed substantial disagreements between patient-reported and clinician-documented symptoms. Disagreement resulted in a considerable proportion of MPI appropriateness ratings also being incongruous.},

From 12 April 2009 to 10 April 2010, we estimate that approximately 60.8 million cases (range: 43.3-89.3 million), 274,304 hospitalizations (195,086-402,719), and 12,469 deaths (8868-18,306) occurred in the United States due to pH1N1. Eighty-seven percent of deaths occurred in those under 65 years of age with children and working adults having risks of hospitalization and death 4 to 7 times and 8 to 12 times greater, respectively, than estimates of impact due to seasonal influenza covering the years 1976-2001. In our study, adults 65 years of age or older were found to have rates of hospitalization and death that were up to 75\% and 81\%, respectively, lower than seasonal influenza. These results confirm the necessity of a concerted public health response to pH1N1.},

This study compared the age distribution of influenza-related deaths in the United States during this century's three influenza A pandemics with that of the following epidemics. Half of influenza-related deaths during the 1968-1969 influenza A (H3N2) pandemic and large proportions of influenza-related deaths during the 1957-1958 influenza A (H2N2) and the 1918-1919 influenza A (H1N1) pandemics occurred among persons {$<$}65 years old. However, this group accounted for decrementally smaller proportions of deaths during the first decade following each pandemic. A model suggested that this mortality pattern may be explained by selective acquisition of protection against fatal illness among younger persons. The large proportion of influenza-related deaths during each pandemic and the following decade among persons {$<$}65 years old should be considered in planning for pandemics.},

  abstract = {Background: neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors have recently become available for treatment of influenza. Rapid antigen detection assays at `point-of-care' may improve the accuracy of clinical diagnosis, but the value of these techniques in assisting with the appropriate use of antivirals remains controversial. Objective: to compare the diagnostic utilities of two management strategies for influenza, empirical antiviral therapy versus therapy based on a positive rapid test result in pre-epidemic and epidemic periods. Study design: a threshold decision analytic model was designed to compare these competing strategies and sensitivity analysis performed to examine the impact of diagnostic variables on the expected utility of the decision with a range of prior probabilities of infection between 1 and 50\%. Results: on the basis of the calculated sensitivity (77\%) and specificity (95\%) of a point-of-care test for influenza, pre-treatment testing was preferred and cost-effective in non-epidemic stage of the influenza cycle. The alternative strategy of empirical treatment produces a higher utility value during epidemics, but may result in overuse of antivirals for low-risk populations. The two strategies had equivalent efficacy when the probability of influenza was 42\%. Conclusions: Patients with flu-like illness, who present outside the influenza outbreak and are considered to be at low risk for influenza-related complications, should be tested to confirm the diagnosis before starting antiviral treatment with a NA inhibitor. The most important variables in the model were the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis and the pre-test probability of influenza. A threshold probability of influenza of 42\% would dictate changing from the rapid testing strategy to a `treat regardless' strategy.},

Study Design Cross-sectional survey. Methods Between March and May 2020, a survey consisting of 20 common descriptors for dizziness within five domains (lightheadedness, motion sensitivity, imbalance, vision complaints, and pain) was completed by patients at two outpatient otolaryngology clinics. Surveys were subsequently obtained from otolaryngology and non-otolaryngology providers attending a multidisciplinary dizziness lecture. The primary outcome measure was to assess for differences in definition of dizziness between patients and providers. Secondary outcome measures included assessing differences between otolaryngologists and non-otolaryngologists. Results About 221 patients and 100 providers participated. Patients selected a median of 7 terms compared to 8 for providers (P = .375), although providers had a larger overall distribution of number of terms selected (P = .038). Patients were more likely than providers to define dizziness according to the following domains: lightheadedness (difference 15.0\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 5.5\%\textendash 25.3\%), vision complaints (difference 21.6\%, 95\% CI 12.0\%\textendash 29.6\%), and pain (difference 11.5\%, 95\% CI 4.7\%\textendash 17.1\%). Providers were more likely to define dizziness according to the motion sensitivity domain (difference 13.8\%, 95\% CI 6.8\%\textendash 19.6\%). Otolaryngology and non-otolaryngology providers defined dizziness similarly across symptom domains. Conclusion Although patients and providers both view dizziness as imbalance, patients more commonly describe dizziness in the context of lightheadedness, vision complaints, and pain, whereas providers more frequently define dizziness according to motion sensitivity. These semantic differences create an additional barrier to effective patient-provider communication. Level of Evidence 4. Laryngoscope, 131:E1443\textendash E1449, 2021},

We investigated the global mortality burden using an indirect estimation approach and 2 publicly available data sets: the Human Mortality Database (13 countries) and data extracted from the records of the Statistical Abstract for British India. The all-cause Human Mortality Database was used to estimate mortality annually for 1916\textendash 1921 for detailed age groups. Three different calculation methods were applied to the data (low, medium, and high scenarios), and we used a multilevel regression model to control for distorting factors (e.g., war and the underlying time trend in mortality). Total pandemic mortality was an estimated 15 million deaths worldwide in 1918 (n =\hspace{0.6em}2.5 million in 1919) after including the rates for British India and controlling for wars and the underlying mortality trend. According to our validity analysis, simulations of total number of deaths being greater than 25 million are not realistic based on the underlying mortality rates included in Human Mortality Database and in British India. Our results suggest the global death impact of the 1918 pandemic was important (n\hspace{0.6em}=\hspace{0.6em}17.4 million) but not as severe as most frequently cited estimates.},

We examine use and interpretation of the statistic currently referred to as the calibration slope.

The behaviour of the slope in illustrative hypothetical examples and in two examples in the clinical literature was demonstrated. Results The paper in which the statistic was proposed described it as a measure of ``spread'' and did not use the term ``calibration''. In illustrative examples, slope of 1 can be associated with good or bad calibration, and this holds true across different definitions of calibration. In data extracted from a previous study, the slope was correlated with discrimination, not overall calibration. Many authors of recent papers interpret the slope as a measure of calibration; a minority interpret it as a measure of discrimination or do not explicitly categorise it as either. Seventeen of thirty-three papers used the slope as the sole measure of calibration. Conclusion Misunderstanding about this statistic has led to many papers in which it is the sole measure of calibration, which should be discouraged.},

The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

  abstract = {Influenza virus infection and disease historically contribute to widespread cases of seasonal morbidity and in some cases mortality. Prompt and accurate diagnosis is crucial for optimal patient management. Rapid influenza direct antigen testing (RIDT) offers a faster turn-around-time for results but test performance (ie, sensitivity and specificity) varies widely. Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) can offer a viable alternative. The objective of this retrospective study was to compare the test performance of RIDT with NAAT. RIDT testing included the Directigen EZ Flu A+B or the Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu A+B. NAAT employed the SimplexaTM Flu A/B\texttrademark{} RSV assay. A total of 5,795 specimens collected from October to March for the 2012/2013 (n=953), 2013/2014 (n=2060) and 2014/2015 (n=2783) seasons were co-tested by RIDT and NAAT. Using NAAT as the gold standard, RIDT tests had a sensitivity range of 0 to 15.7\% and a specificity of 98.2 to 100\% for influenza type A. For influenza type B, RIDT tests had a sensitivity of 0 to 33.3\% and a specificity of 98.9 to 100\%. These findings suggest that RIDT has unacceptably low sensitivity for both influenza A and influenza B, despite high specificity. The key advantage of RIDT in previous years (faster turnaround time) has been challenged by newer NAAT technology that provides results in a turn-around-time comparable to RIDT, but with superior test performance.},

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for influenza A/B was performed as reference test. Diagnostic accuracy of the Flu Score (1\texttimes{} onset \&lt;48 hours + 2\texttimes{} myalgia + 1\texttimes{} chills or sweats + 2\texttimes{} fever and cough) was expressed as area under the curve (AUC), calibration slopes and likelihood ratios (LRs).A total of 273 patients (15\%) had influenza on PCR. The AUC of the Flu Score during winter months was 0.66 [95\% CI (95\% confidence internal) 0.63\textendash 0.70]. During peak influenza season, both influenza prevalence (24\%) and AUC were higher [0.71 (95\% CI 0.66\textendash 0.76], but calibration remained poor. The Flu Score assigned 64\% of the patients as `low-risk' (10\% had influenza, LR - 0.6). About 12\% were classified as `high risk' of whom 32\% had influenza (LR + 2.7). During peak influenza season, 60\% and 14\% of patients were classified as low and high risk, respectively, with influenza prevalences being 14\% (LR - 0.5) and 50\% (LR + 3.2).The Flu-Score attributes a small subgroup of patients with a high influenza risk (prevalence 32\%). However, clinical usefulness is limited because this group is small and the association between predicted and observed risks is poor. Considerable diagnostic imprecision remains when it comes to differentiating those with influenza on clinical grounds from the many other causes of LRTI in primary care. New point of care tests are required that accurately, rapidly and cost effectively detect influenza in patients with respiratory tract symptoms in primary care.},

  abstract = {Predictive models have been developed for influenza but have seldom been validated. Typically they have focused on patients meeting a definition of infection that includes fever. Less is known about how models perform when more symptoms are considered. We, therefore, aimed to create and internally validate predictive scores of acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms to diagnose influenza virus infection as confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from respiratory specimens. Data from a completed trial to study the indirect effect of influenza immunization in Hutterite communities were randomly split into two independent groups for model derivation and validation. We applied different multivariable modelling techniques and constructed Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves to determine predictive indexes at different cut-points. From 2008\textendash 2011, 3288 first seasonal ARI episodes and 321 (9.8\%) influenza positive events occurred in 2202 individuals. In children up to 17 years, the significant predictors of influenza virus infection were fever, chills, and cough along with being of age 6 years and older. In adults, presence of chills and cough but not fever were highly specific for influenza virus infection (sensitivity 30\%, specificity 96\%). Performance of the models in the validation set was not significantly different. The predictors were consistently found to be significant irrespective of the multivariable technique. Symptomatic predictors of influenza virus infection vary between children and adults. The scores could assist clinicians in their test and treat decisions but the results need to be externally validated prior to application in clinical practice.},

  abstract = {ContextOutpatients with suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) have nonspecific signs and symptoms. Missed DVT diagnosis may result in fatal pulmonary embolism. Since many patients may have DVT, a selective and efficient diagnostic process is needed.ObjectiveTo systematically review trials that determined the prevalence of DVT using clinical prediction rules either with or without D-dimer, for the diagnosis of DVT.Data SourcesEnglish- and French-language studies were identified from MEDLINE from 1990 to July 2004 and supplemented by a review of all relevant bibliographies.Study SelectionWe included studies that prospectively enrolled consecutive, unselected outpatients with suspected DVT and applied clinical prediction rules before D-dimer testing or diagnostic imaging. All studies included sufficient information to allow the calculation of the prevalence of DVT for at least 1 of the 3 clinical probability estimates (low, moderate, or high). We required that patients be followed up for a minimum 3-month period. Unless the clinical model incorporated prior DVT, studies were excluded if patients with a history of prior DVT were enrolled.Data ExtractionTwo reviewers independently reviewed and abstracted data for estimating the prevalence of DVT, sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs) of D-dimer in each of the 3 clinical probability estimates. Data for the D-dimer in all studies were pooled and analyzed as high-sensitivity/low-specificity test or a moderate-sensitivity/moderate-specificity test.Data SynthesisFourteen studies involving more than 8000 patients used 1 clinical prediction rule for diagnosing DVT, of which 11 incorporated D-dimer testing in the diagnostic algorithm. The prevalence of DVT in the low, moderate, and high clinical probability groups was 5.0\% (95\% CI, 4.0\%-8.0\%), 17\% (95\% CI, 13\%-23\%), and 53\% (95\% CI, 44\%-61\%), respectively. The overall prevalence of DVT was 19\% (95\% CI, 16\%-23\%). Pooling all studies, the sensitivity, specificity, and negative LRs of D-dimer testing in the low probability group were 88\% (95\% CI, 81\%-92\%), 72\% (95\% CI, 65\%-78\%), and 0.18\% (95\% CI, 0.12-0.18); in the moderate probability group: 90\% (95\% CI, 80\%-95\%), 58\% (95\% CI, 49\%-67\%), and 0.19\% (95\% CI, 0.11-0.32); and in the high probability group: 92\% (95\% CI, 85\%-96\%), 45\% (95\% CI, 37\%-52\%), and 0.16\% (95\% CI, 0.09-0.30). The LRs for a normal result on a high or moderately sensitive D-dimer assay among patients with: (1) low clinical suspicion were 0.10 (95\% CI, 0.03-0.37) and 0.20 (95\% CI, 0.12-0.31); (2) moderate clinical suspicion were 0.05 (95\% CI, 0.01-0.21) and 0.23 (95\% CI, 0.13-0.39); and (3) high clinical suspicion were 0.07 (95\% CI, 0.03-0.18) and 0.15 (95\% CI, 0.10-0.38).ConclusionsDiagnostic accuracy for DVT improves when clinical probability is estimated before diagnostic tests. Patients with low clinical probability on the predictive rule have prevalence of DVT of less than 5\%. In low-probability patients with negative D-dimer results, diagnosis of DVT can be excluded without ultrasound; in patients with high clinical suspicion for DVT, results should not affect clinical decisions.},

  abstract = {Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has lasted much longer than an influenza season, but the main signs, symptoms, and some imaging findings are similar in COVID-19 and influenza patients. The aim of the current study was to construct an accurate and robust model for initial screening and differential diagnosis of COVID-19 and influenza A. Methods: All patients in the study were diagnosed at Fuyang No. 2 People's Hospital, and they included 151 with COVID-19 and 155 with influenza A. The patients were randomly assigned to training set or a testing set at a 4:1 ratio. Predictor variables were selected based on importance, assessed by random forest algorithms, and analyzed to develop classification and regression tree models. Results: In the optimal model A, the best single predictor of COVID-19 patients was a normal or high level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, followed by low level of creatine kinase, then the presence of {$<$}3 respiratory symptoms, then a highest temperature on the first day of admission {$<$}38\textdegree C. In the suboptimal model B, the best single predictor of COVID-19 was a low eosinophil count, then a normal monocyte ratio, then a normal hematocrit value, then a highest temperature on the first day of admission of {$<$}37\textdegree C, then a complete lack of respiratory symptoms. Conclusions: The two models provide clinicians with a rapid triage tool. The optimal model can be used to developed countries/regions and major hospitals, and the suboptimal model can be used in underdeveloped regions and small hospitals.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite substantial use of the telephone in health care, only a few studies have formally evaluated the appropriateness of telephone-based management for acute medical problems. The accuracy of patients' report of signs and symptoms remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: We compared the agreement between patient self-assessment and clinician assessment on the typical signs and symptoms of group A beta-haemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS) to investigate the potential difficulties of using patient self-report to triage sore throat patients. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, each of 200 adult pharyngitis patients was instructed to examine him/herself and to record the symptoms and physical findings. Two clinicians independently interviewed and examined each patient and recorded their findings. Each patient then had a rapid GABHS antigen test, the results of which were blinded to both clinicians and patients. Each patient self-assessment was compared with the findings of each clinician, and the agreement and disagreement between them computed. RESULTS: We found varying levels of agreement (kappa=-0.05 to 0.71) between patients and clinicians on sore throat history and physical assessments. Importantly, there was fair to substantial agreement (kappa=0.20-0.71) on the key signs and symptoms used in GABHS clinical prediction rules. As expected, history items had the highest agreement (kappa=0.52-0.71). Patients were more likely than clinicians to report rather than deny a specific physical sign. CONCLUSION: Adult sore throat patients may reliably report their symptoms, but may not be able to assess and report accurately on relevant physical signs of pharyngitis. Patients have a tendency to over-report physical signs. This study indicates the potential difficulties associated with telephone triage of sore throat patients, or other illnesses that require assessment of physical signs.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reliability of measurements is a prerequisite of medical research. For nominal data, Fleiss' kappa (in the following labelled as Fleiss' K) and Krippendorff's alpha provide the highest flexibility of the available reliability measures with respect to number of raters and categories. Our aim was to investigate which measures and which confidence intervals provide the best statistical properties for the assessment of inter-rater reliability in different situations. METHODS: We performed a large simulation study to investigate the precision of the estimates for Fleiss' K and Krippendorff's alpha and to determine the empirical coverage probability of the corresponding confidence intervals (asymptotic for Fleiss' K and bootstrap for both measures). Furthermore, we compared measures and confidence intervals in a real world case study. RESULTS: Point estimates of Fleiss' K and Krippendorff's alpha did not differ from each other in all scenarios. In the case of missing data (completely at random), Krippendorff's alpha provided stable estimates, while the complete case analysis approach for Fleiss' K led to biased estimates. For shifted null hypotheses, the coverage probability of the asymptotic confidence interval for Fleiss' K was low, while the bootstrap confidence intervals for both measures provided a coverage probability close to the theoretical one. CONCLUSIONS: Fleiss' K and Krippendorff's alpha with bootstrap confidence intervals are equally suitable for the analysis of reliability of complete nominal data. The asymptotic confidence interval for Fleiss' K should not be used. In the case of missing data or data or higher than nominal order, Krippendorff's alpha is recommended. Together with this article, we provide an R-script for calculating Fleiss' K and Krippendorff's alpha and their corresponding bootstrap confidence intervals.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cohen's Kappa is the most used agreement statistic in literature. However, under certain conditions, it is affected by a paradox which returns biased estimates of the statistic itself. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to provide sufficient information which allows the reader to make an informed choice of the correct agreement measure, by underlining some optimal properties of Gwet's AC1 in comparison to Cohen's Kappa, using a real data example. METHOD: During the process of literature review, we have asked a panel of three evaluators to come up with a judgment on the quality of 57 randomized controlled trials assigning a score to each trial using the Jadad scale. The quality was evaluated according to the following dimensions: adopted design, randomization unit, type of primary endpoint. With respect to each of the above described features, the agreement between the three evaluators has been calculated using Cohen's Kappa statistic and Gwet's AC1 statistic and, finally, the values have been compared with the observed agreement. RESULTS: The values of the Cohen's Kappa statistic would lead to believe that the agreement levels for the variables Unit, Design and Primary Endpoints are totally unsatisfactory. The AC1 statistic, on the contrary, shows plausible values which are in line with the respective values of the observed concordance. CONCLUSION: We conclude that it would always be appropriate to adopt the AC1 statistic, thus bypassing any risk of incurring the paradox and drawing wrong conclusions about the results of agreement analysis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of neuraminidase-inhibiting anti-viral medication to treat influenza is relatively infrequent. Rapid, cost-effective methods for diagnosing influenza are needed to enable appropriate prescribing. Multi-viral respiratory panels using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays to diagnose influenza are accurate but expensive and more time-consuming than low sensitivity rapid influenza tests. Influenza clinical decision algorithms are both rapid and inexpensive, but most are based on regression analyses that do not account for higher order interactions. This study used classification and regression trees (CART) modeling to estimate probabilities of influenza. METHODS: Eligible enrollees\,{$\geq$}\,5~years old (n\,=\,4,173) who presented at ambulatory centers for treatment of acute respiratory illness ({$\leq$}7~days) with cough or fever in 2011-2012, provided nasal and pharyngeal swabs for PCR testing for influenza, information on demographics, symptoms, personal characteristics and self-reported influenza vaccination status. RESULTS: Antiviral medication was prescribed for just 15~\% of those with PCR-confirmed influenza. An algorithm that included fever, cough, and fatigue had sensitivity of 84~\%, specificity of 48~\%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 23~\% and negative predictive value (NPV) of 94~\% for the development sample. CONCLUSIONS: The CART algorithm has good sensitivity and high NPV, but low PPV for identifying influenza among outpatients {$\geq$}5~years. Thus, it is good at identifying a group who do not need testing or antivirals and had fair to good predictive performance for influenza. Further testing of the algorithm in other influenza seasons would help to optimize decisions for lab testing or treatment.},

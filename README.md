## Project Description

We analyzed the predictive power of patient-reported symptom data in comparison to clinician reported symptom data to predict clinical diagnosis with influenza and lab-confirmed diagnosis. We also analyzed the agreement between patient and clinician symptoms, as well as the agreement between PCR and RADT diagnostic methods.

## Data

The data used in this analysis was collected from a university health center from December 2016 through February 2017. Patients with an upper respiratory complaint were required to fill out a questionnaire before their visit, which included several questions about the presence or absence of symptoms. Patients were required to answer all questions on the survey. At the time of the visit, a clinician was required to mark the same symptoms as present or absent. The duration of illness and prescence of 18 symptoms were assessed by both the clinician and patient. The data is saved as **Data.csv** and **Data.Rda**. More details of the study design and data collection have been published previously. (Dale AP, Ebell M, McKay B, Handel A, Forehand R, Dobbin K.

## Files

### Data

The anonymized and cleaned data are both included in this folder of this project.

### Products

The manuscript and any presentations that have been created for the project are included.

### R

This file contains all of the data cleaning and analysis code. There is an
additional README in that file with more detailed information.

### Results

The figures, tables, and data used for or created by data analysis are documented in this folder.

# `Wrapper.R`

This is a shortcut R script that will run all of the code needed to reproduce
our analysis. Running this may be time intensive, but will ensure that all
parts of the code are run in the correct order.
